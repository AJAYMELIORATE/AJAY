A doctor has a clinic where he serves his patients. The doctor�s consultation fees are different for different groups of patients depending on their age. If the patient�s age is below 17, fees is 200 INR. If the patient�s age is between 17 and 40, fees is 400 INR. If patient�s age is above 40, fees is 300 INR. Write a code to calculate earnings in a day for which one array/List of values representing age of patients visited on that day is passed as input.
Note:
�	Age should not be zero or less than zero or above 120
�	Doctor consults a maximum of 20 patients a day
�	Enter age value (press Enter without a value to stop):
Example 1:
�	Input

�	Output
